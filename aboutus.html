  <h2>About Explore Kerala</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    This is the official website of Kerala Tourism, one of the most popular travel websites 
    in India. The site contains exhaustive information on God's Own Country- Kerala.
     The website is currently available in English, Malayalam, Hindi and other four 
     international languages viz. French, German, Italian, Spanish & Chinese.
      On an average, the site gets 1,25,000 visitors a month and a visitor spends around
       seven minutes on the website. Kerala Tourism has won several awards. It bagged the 
       prestigious 'Award of Excellence' instituted by the Government of India for the 
       'Most Innovative Use of Information Technology / Best Tourism Website / Portal'
        during the period 2000-2001, 2002-2003, 2005-2006 respectively. Among the State 
        Tourism Departments of India, Kerala Tourism is the first to receive the award.
         Kerala Tourism Website also bagged Net 4 PC World Web Award 2008 for Best 
         Indian Website in Tourism category, instituted by PC World Magazine. International 
         recognition to the department's online initiatives came in the form of Pacific Asia
          Travel Association's (PATA) Gold Award for the best E- Newsletter in the year 2005.
           The newsletter currently has a worldwide subscription of nearly 85,000. The website
            became functional on 24 December 1998. The site is updated every month.	 
            The tourism department of Kerala boasts that the state is God's Own Country. 
            Once you visit, you will see where this claim comes from. The state really is 
            blessed with great natural beauty, and diverse ecology.

The state is also considered to be one of the safest regions of India. Incidents of local
 people cheating tourists are almost non-existent. Kerala has high standards of living 
 compared to its neighbours and other Indian states and has social lifestyle indices such 
 as education and healthcare that are on par with developed countries [2]. Therefore tourists
  can relax without being followed around by taxi drivers, touts, guides and similar.
   However still be prepared to put up with beggars who have migrated from poorer 
   neighbouring states. Abundant rainfall means that you can find lush greenery that remains
    pretty much throughout the year. A holiday here is an opportunity for rejuvenation. 
    You can get an Ayurvedic oil massage, spend a day or two on a houseboat with nothing
     to do but watch coconut trees pass by, or just laze around on Kovalam or Varkala beaches. 
     Thus tourism is more experiential here, rather than being composed of superficial 
     sightseeing options.

Kerala was named as one of the "ten paradises of the world" and "50 places of a lifetime" by 
the National Geographic Traveler magazine. Kerala is a state wedged between the Western Ghats
 on the eastern side and the Arabian Sea on the West, thus having a wide range of topography
  from high altitude mountains to golden beaches and is criss crossed by 41 rivers.
   The tributaries, unique backwaters, lagoons and numerous small islands provide many scenic 
   attractions for visitors.
